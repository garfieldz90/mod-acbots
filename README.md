# Playerbots Module

This is a WIP Playerbots module for AzerothCore based on IKE3 Playerbots.

These Playerbots use actual player data, so it is capable to use own alts and play with own party, level up characters, and more. It is mostly usuable but still has many bugs that need to be resolved. Also please note that including this module will currently significantly increase compilation time for AzerothCore.

Many, many thanks to celguar who is maintain mangosbot branch that this code is port from: https://github.com/celguar/mangosbot-bots
